Modern, minimal personal introduction site built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.
It uses JavaScript and a lightweight Java HTTP server.

## Development

1. Compile and run the server:
   ```
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```
2. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

The page uses Tailwind via CDN, greets visitors based on the time of day, and offers a dark mode toggle.
